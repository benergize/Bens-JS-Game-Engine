# Bens-JS-Game-Engine

Howdy neighbor. 

This is a WIP game engine I'm building just for kicks. This is my attempt at creating an easy to use, highly flexible/repurposable game development tool. This is sort of an homage to the game development tools I used as a kid, like Mark Overmar's 'Game Maker,' and Al Staffieri's 'Game Maker' (no relation between the two).

No documentation yet, but the code is pretty self explanetory and things should be easy to navigate. A test game I'm building around the engine is <a href = 'https://github.com/benergize/Rogue-Renewal'>here</a>.

That's all for now.
